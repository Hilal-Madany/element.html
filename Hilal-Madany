            <h2>Introduction 🚀</h2>
            <p>As engineers, we often encounter complex calculations that directly impact the efficiency and effectiveness of our designs. The Gross Area of a Pleated Element (Gross Area) is a critical parameter in filtration engineering. It determines the available surface area for filtration, which affects factors like airflow, dust holding capacity, and filter efficiency.</p>

        <section id="the-formula">
            <h2>The Formula 🔍</h2>
            <p>The formula for calculating the Gross Area of a Pleated Element is straightforward:</p>
            <p>Gross Area = No of Pleats × 2 × Depth of Pleat × Length of Element</p>
            <p>Here's a breakdown of the components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No of Pleats:</strong> In our case study, we have 49 pleats.</li>
                <li><strong>Depth of Pleats:</strong> Each pleat has a depth of 10 mm.</li>
                <li><strong>Length of Element:</strong> The element's length measures 200 mm.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let's do the math:</p>
            <pre>
                Gross Area = 49 × 2 × 10 × 200
                Gross Area = 196,000 mm²
            </pre>
